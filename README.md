## Installation

Clone repository and update submodules if you want to build unit tests:
```
git clone git@github.com:machineware-gmbh/mwr
cd mwr
git submodule update --init
```
Building `mwr` requires `cmake >= 3.11`. During configuration you must state
whether to build the unit tests and the example programs:
* `-DMWR_BUILD_TESTS=[ON|OFF]`: build unit tests (default `OFF`)
* `-DMWR_LINTER=<string>`: linter program to use (default `<empty>`)
```
mkdir -p BUILD/RELEASE/BUILD
cd BUILD/RELEASE/BUILD
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. \
      -DMWR_BUILD_TESTS=ON
make -j 4
make test
make install
```
If everything went well, the following artifacts will have been installed:
* mwr headers in `BUILD/RELEASE/include`
* mwr library in `BUILD/RELEASE/lib`

----
## Integration
You can use `mwr` as a submodule within `cmake` projects. For example:
```
add_subdirectory(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/mwr)
...
target_link_libraries(my_target mwr)
```
